A Walk in the Park is a REND386 .WLD file from Chapter 15 of the book The
Virtual Reality Contruct Kit by Joe Gradecki. It is a park setting with
trees, grass, a sculpture, benches and a sidewalk.

The chapter in the book uses this world to discuss how to interface this
world with a Treadmill or Bicycle.  While you won't find that information in
this upload, all of the C source, .PLG's and .WLD are there.

You need REND386 to view this world!

Subj:  WLD: Virtual Scuba
File:  SCUBA.ZIP (21080 bytes)
AUTHOR:    Dennis McKenzie - DennisM357@aol.com

Virtual SCUBA .  Underwater world with lots of denizens and currents.
Requires a fairly fast machine to run well.  I am still in the learning phase
and would appreciate comments/suggestions. The speed of the animations was
gauged on a P90, but I tried to make them fast enough for a 486.

Thanks,
Dennis McKenzie

This is an entire house that could theoretically be built.  I designed it and

The glove works exceptionally well to pick up things.
