It all started back in 2001 when I graduated from college and moved to the
Inner Sunset neighborhood of San Francisco.  At nearly all intersections in
San Francisco you will see the street names etched &#8212; sometimes not so
carefully &#8212; into the concrete sidewalk.
Every day I'd walk past the corner of 6th Ave and Judah St and smile when
I saw JUDHA [sic] there in the sidewalk.  If I was walking with a friend,
I'd point it out with great amusement, at which point said friend would
usually walk away while reconsidering our friendship.

Sadly, the sidewalks at that intersection were replaced (and the misspelling
corrected) years ago, and I never took the time to take a photo before that
happened.
Fortunately, the city is full of similarly jumbled sidewalk etchings, and
now many years later I find myself walking around with a camera-enabled
phone in my pocket, so I finally started to document these misspellings.
Herewith a small sampling of those that I&#8217;ve found thus far.

<p>Sometimes two letters get swapped:<br />

OFFARRELL [sic]<br />
O'Farrell St and St Joseph's Ave<br />
<br/></p>

<p>Bonus!  It's not a street name, but this is my favorite sidewalk
etching in San Francisco.
Yes, it's a bit crude, but I think it's great that of all the things
this person could immortalize in concrete, they chose this visual pun:<br />
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrispcampbell/4610314599/in/set-72157624069169230/"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1357/4610314599_b7be26066c.jpg"/></a><br />
TWO MEN WALKING A BREAST<br />

My compulsion is unlikely to go away any time soon, so I'll continue to
keep [this Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrispcampbell/sets/72157624069169230/)
updated as I find more. 
If you know of any particularly good ones, add a comment and I'll go check it out.
